Today we're going to harness some additional features of HTML as well as work some more with CSS

Let's start by adding some additional structure to the HTML editing portion of the codepen

First, define a `header` and a `body` by adding the following:

    <head></head>
    <body></body>

In HTML, we can import code into headers to be referenced on the page, today let's import a web-safe font from Google,
you can learn more about importing fonts here: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_fonts.asp & check out all 
of Google's courtesy fonts here: https://fonts.google.com/

Add the following to your header to import our font:

<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Codystar' rel='stylesheet'>

Now, within the `<body></body>` tags, setup the body of the page and reference the imported font in the CSS editor:

body {
  background: #222;
  font-family: 'Codystar';
  font-size: 44px;
  place-items: center;
}

Setup the module div's text configurations:

.module {
  background: #222;
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem;
}

Add the "Power Pellets" to the maze by adding the following to the module div:

∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ #NOLACODESBLACK ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙

You should now have a black background with white, dotted text appearing in the interpreter.


After setting up the  create the gradient "maze walls", add the following to the CSS editor:

.module-border-wrap {
  max-height: 800px;
  max-width: 800px;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, red, green);
  padding: 3px;
}

Finally, to create "Blacman", Layer the `blacman` div within the module div and add the following to CSS:

.blacman {
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    display: inline-block;
    border-right: 17.5px solid transparent;
    border-top: 17.5px solid #ffde00;
    border-left: 17.5px solid #ffde00;
    border-bottom: 17.5px solid #ffde00;
    border-top-left-radius: 17.5px;
    border-top-right-radius: 17.5px;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 17.5px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 17.5px;
}

Congratulations! You're done! The final result should look like this: https://codepen.io/jillianntish/pen/OJVRmYm

Now if you followed the steps correctly you have a static pacman going after some power pellets,

Stay tuned for part two where we animate blacman!
